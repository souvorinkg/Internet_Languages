# Importance of Translators and Wikipedia in Digital Language Hierarchies within Europe #

*Kolya Souvorin*

**Abstract:**
The Internet serves many functions that help citizens be informed and participate in
democracy and the economy in the digital age—the right to access the Internet links to the right
to use your native language. The EU’s language policy translates all documents into its official
languages, and the resulting corpus makes translation and research within these languages
easier. The paper attempts to identify whether the languages of the EU have greater utility on
the Internet by comparing a broad measure of total contents and services in the languages of
Europe. Economic and linguistic differences between member countries are possible
explanations for the digital divide in Europe. EU official languages dovetail with high general
internet utility. The study concluded that within Europe, EU language policy developed strong
wikipedias in the EU languages, which was associated with gains in content overall in those
languages.
